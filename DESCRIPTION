Description: This package supplies a visual tool to assess the influence of single observations on the choice of the penalty parameter in ridge regressions, based on the approach of Hellton, Lingj√¶re and De Bin (2020) (arxiv.org/abs/1911.03662). It supplies a curve plot of the optimal ridge tuning paramer when up- or downweighting each observation to identify observations as shrinkers or expanders.
